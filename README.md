# Fascin
This repository is a collection of scripts used in the project "Fascin structural plasticity mediates flexible actin bundle construction," which has been pre-printed on bioRXiv here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.03.574123v2

The scripts used to process cryo-EM and cryo-ET data of F-actin bundled by fascin may be found in the directories "single_particle" and "tomo," respectively. These scripts were developed by Matthew Reynolds.

The scripts used in geometric modeling of fascin-bundled F-actin networks may be found in the "modeling" directory. These scripts were developed by Keith Carney.
